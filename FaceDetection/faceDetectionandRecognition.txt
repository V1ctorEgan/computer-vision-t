face detection is a computer vision task where we identify the present and location of a face
face recognition is when you have a face and you need to know who the face belongs to.

face detection process:
    scan images for faces
    look for features ( like edges and texture)
    mark areas in the face.

face recognition process:
    face embedding: this envolves representing every face with a vector aka faceprint. that is representing every face with a bunch
    of numbers
    face recognition: search database of known faceprints and compare with the face embedded (compute similarity scores)
    then find the closest one.
    
    face embedding is done by measuring the distances between features on the face like the eyes, nose and mouth, etc.


in terms of computational methods, the traditional approach use methods like viola jones; which looked for patterns like where
are the eyes , nose or mouth.
    but the modern method relies on deep learning, specifically for face detectcion, we use MTCNN; Multi-tasked cascaded 
    convulotional networks
    and for face recognition we use inceptionResNet (face embedding and face matching)

practical applications:
1. security systems
2. smartPhones: face unlock or selfie enhancement
3. social media: automatic tagging of faces
4.Law enforcement
5. health care: 
6. virtual reality.

challenges
1. variation in lighting can make face detection/recognition difficult
2. different angles of faces
3.

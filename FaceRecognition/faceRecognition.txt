face embedding are vectors, mathematical representation of the extracted features of a face.
we can put a face in a neural network algorithm and get the result as a vectors
e.g: someone face = [0.0423, -0.456,0.3095]. this is also called face print
each of the above dimensions in the vector represents an extracted feature of the face.
the dimensions can range from 128 to 512

- embedding that are close might be the same person
- we can create a database of face embeddings of people we know their identity
- then to identify someone we can run it through a neural network algorithm to generate a face embedding then check the closest to in our
 database.

 -a neural network algorithm we can use is a inception-Resnet V1
 - inception model was created by google in 2014 as a way to better make use of neurons
 it makes use of convolutional layers made up of 1x1,3x3 and 5x5 filters in parallel, extracting features at different
 scale
 inception model apply these filters in parallel
 inception- Resnet v1 model uses and inception model along with a residual connection.:
 a residual connection is added to each inception module.
 inception residual are faster to train and perform better than a regular inception module
